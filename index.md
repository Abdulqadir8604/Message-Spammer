## Welcome to My Page

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Abdulqadir8604/Message-Spammer/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown


```
import pyautogui
import time

time.sleep(5)
f = open("text", 'r')
for word in f:
    pyautogui.typewrite(word)
    pyautogui.press("enter")
```
